# Description

This is the repo for my capstone project. This project is a full stack web app using React, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL server, and MVC technologies. This project was made to help teachers keep track of their students' attendance through an interactive UI, and I'm planning on continuing this project in the future and giving it more features.
